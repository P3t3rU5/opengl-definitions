# Opengl Definitions

This gem contains definitions for OpenGL functions and extensions.

It's not meant to be executable code. Instead it's focus is to provide constants and function definitions to Ruby.
They can then be used with FFI, for example.

## Installation

(Warning: gem not yet released)
